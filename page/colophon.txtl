Credit where credit is due.

This site is powered by "Avocado":http://bitbucket.org/agj/avocado, a Perl web 
framework that I shat out. Pages are generated using Textile and Markdown. YAML and 
embedded Textile are used for page meta data.

"Lighttpd":http://lighttpd.net serves static content and processes dynamic content
using FCGI and PSGI. "Varnish":http://varnish-cache.org is used for response 
caching. "Postfix":http://www.postfix.org/ pushes out SMTP. Who cares whether
I use emacs or vim? :wq

This design uses "Pacifico":http://www.newtypography.co.uk/ for the main logo, 
edited with Inkscape. "Puritan":http://www.readingtype.org.uk/ was used for headings.
