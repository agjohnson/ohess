This site is built on top of "Plack":http://plackperl.org/ using a custom rolled
framework. Pages are generated using Textile and Markdown. YAML and embedded
Textile are used for page meta data.

"Lighttpd":http://lighttpd.net serves static content and processes dynamic
content using PSGI. "Varnish":http://varnish-cache.org is used for response
caching. "Postfix":http://www.postfix.org/ pushes out SMTP. Who cares whether I
use emacs or vim? :wq
