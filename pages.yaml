        Searching for a stream dashboard for resource events, I created Statis as a
        supplemental dashboard.

        Version 0.1003 is the latest stable release. The .10 release includes
        better logging and reporting, on_repair triggers, and several command
        line option changes.

        Recently, while trying to set up a small failover cluster of servers, I found
        myself scouring for a lot of answers. This struck me as strange, however
        it seems high-availability lacks momentum in the open source community.

      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        Running several pkgsrc boxes on top of Rackspace Cloud, all which use
        the same kernel and release, it makes a lot of sense to build binary 
        packages once, on a single machine. The easiest way to do this is to 
        have a dedicated build server -- something which is very simple in a
        cloud hosting environment.
    - title: NetBSD Pkgsrc on Linux
      column: left
      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        There are several reasons for running pkgsrc on top of Linux, one reason
        being a common package management, and common packages for server daemons
        across a mixed environment of Linux distributions and FreeBSD or NetBSD 
        boxes. I use Debian Squeeze with pkgsrc, and had limited success with
        Centos 5.5 and pkgsrc, however I would like to test Centos 6, now that it
        is finally released, as well as outline my build process for my server cluster.
        Hopefully I will time soon. For now:

      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        Csistck is a configuration automation tool, similiar in theory to Chef.
        I have started to add a few examples of how I use Csistck to manage my
        own servers.
        
        
        I included a basic example of how I deploy csistck maintenance scripts across
        a large number of hosts, using Fabric. The example uses git, as I use that 
        internally.
