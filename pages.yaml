      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        I cleaned up some bugs and finally bumped to 0.06 release. This is the
        stable release that is usable, but there are still some trivial bugs.
        Planned for 0.7: more package management, better logging on terminal, 
        including possibly detecting terminals with color output -- maybe.

    - title: Pkgsrc Build Server
      link: /pub/pkgsrc-build-server
      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        Running several pkgsrc boxes on top of Rackspace Cloud, all which use
        the same kernel and release, it makes a lot of sense to build binary 
        packages once, on a single machine. The easiest way to do this is to 
        have a dedicated build server -- something which is very simple in a
        cloud hosting environment.
    - title: Managing Passwords, Forget Them
      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        As a system administrator, I have tried many different methods of 
        remembering passwords for several dozen servers worth of root account 
        passwords, MySQL passwords, and user account passwords. Instead of 
        remembering these passwords, or even storing a password list encrypted 
        somewhere, I eventually started generating password hashes using various 
        algoritms. This iteration of the script uses bcrypt and a passphrase to 
        generate hashed and salted passwords.

    - title: NetBSD Pkgsrc on Linux
      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        There are several reasons for running pkgsrc on top of Linux, one reason
        being a common package management, and common packages for server daemons
        across a mixed environment of Linux distributions and FreeBSD or NetBSD 
        boxes. I use Debian Squeeze with pkgsrc, and had limited success with
        Centos 5.5 and pkgsrc, however I would like to test Centos 6, now that it
        is finally released, as well as outline my build process for my server cluster.
        Hopefully I will time soon. For now:

    - title: Csistck Examples
      link: http://bitbucket.org/agj/csistck-examples/overview
      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        Csistck is a configuration automation tool, similiar in theory to Chef.
        I have started to add a few examples of how I use Csistck to manage my
        own servers.
        
        
        I included a basic example of how I deploy csistck maintenance scripts across
        a large number of hosts, using Fabric. The example uses git, as I use that 
        internally.
    - title: Brewing Calculators
      excerpt: !perl/Ohess::Textile >
        I use a custom script to help me brew beer -- specifically, to calculate
        the volume of water I will need to account for various losses in the
        mashing and lautering processes. This is just the start, I will be making
        the script a little more verbose.
